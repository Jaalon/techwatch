== Project Overview

=== Purpose

This application enables managing the complete lifecycle of a *Tech Watch Minute (MVT - Minute Veille Techno)*:

* *Collect* links from the web (manually or via browser extension)
* *Sort* and categorize relevant links
* *Summarize* content automatically using LLM models
* *Generate* export-ready outputs for publication
* *Archive* complete MVT history

The application runs *entirely locally*, with SQLite for persistence and ChromaDB for semantic search.

=== Key Features

* Browser extension for instant link collection
* Automatic MVT cycle management (auto-creation when complete or after 10 links)
* LLM-powered summarization (local or cloud models)
* Dynamic category organization
* Export to plain text format (Confluence-ready)
* Semantic and classic search capabilities
* Complete rejection registry to prevent duplicate imports

== Development Environment Setup

=== Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

* *Java 21* (JDK)
* *Node.js* 18+ with npm
* *Git*

=== Step 1: Clone the Repository

[source,bash]
----
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-name>
----

=== Step 2: Backend Setup

[source,bash]
----
cd backend
./gradlew quarkusDev
----

The backend will start on *http://localhost:8080*

NOTE: On Windows, use `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`

=== Step 3: Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal:

[source,bash]
----
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
----

The frontend will start on *http://localhost:5173*

=== Step 4: Browser Extension Setup

Open another terminal:

[source,bash]
----
cd browser-extension
npm install
npm run watch
----

The extension is compiled to `browser-extension/dist/` and automatically rebuilds on file changes.

IMPORTANT: Ensure you have created all required files before running:

* `src/background.js`
* `src/popup.js`
* `src/popup.html`
* `src/options.js`
* `src/options.html`
* `src/manifest.json`
* `src/icons/` directory with icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png

==== Loading the Extension for Testing

*For Google Chrome:*

. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
. Enable *Developer mode* (toggle in top-right corner)
. Click *Load unpacked*
. Select the `browser-extension/dist/` folder
. The extension appears in your toolbar
. Click the reload icon on the extension card after each rebuild

*For Opera:*

. Open Opera and navigate to `opera://extensions/`
. Enable *Developer mode* (toggle in top-right corner)
. Click *Load unpacked extension*
. Select the `browser-extension/dist/` folder
. The extension appears in your toolbar
. Click the reload icon on the extension card after each rebuild

TIP: When running in watch mode (`npm run watch`), changes are automatically rebuilt. You only need to click the reload button on the extension card in your browser to see updates - no need to remove and re-add the extension.

---

== Building for Production

=== Backend Build

[source,bash]
----
cd backend
./gradlew build
----

Output location: `backend/build/quarkus-app/`

The executable JAR is: `backend/build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`

=== Frontend Build

[source,bash]
----
cd frontend
npm run build
----

Output location: `frontend/dist/`

Static files are optimized and ready for deployment.

=== Browser Extension Build

[source,bash]
----
cd browser-extension
npm run build
----

Output location: `browser-extension/dist/`

The extension is packaged and ready for distribution.

=== Complete Build (All Modules)

Build everything from the project root:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build
----

This compiles:

* Backend → `backend/build/quarkus-app/`
* Frontend → `frontend/dist/`
* Extension → `browser-extension/dist/`

=== Production Build Process Explained

When you run `./gradlew buildAll`, the following happens in order:

. *Frontend Build*
- Runs `npm run build` in the `frontend/` directory
- Compiles React application with Vite
- Outputs optimized static files to `frontend/dist/`
- TypeScript type checking is performed (requires `tsc` from npm dependencies)

. *Extension Build*
- Runs `npm run build` in the `browser-extension/` directory
- Webpack bundles JavaScript files
- Copies manifest.json, HTML files, and icons to `browser-extension/dist/`
- Creates a production-ready extension package

. *Backend Build*
- Automatically runs `copyFrontend` task first
- Copies `frontend/dist/` contents to `backend/build/resources/main/META-INF/resources/`
- Compiles Java backend with Quarkus
- Packages everything into `backend/build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`
- The JAR now contains both the API and the web frontend

Result: A single JAR file that serves both the backend API and frontend UI from http://localhost:8080

=== Building Native Executable (Advanced)

To build a native executable with embedded frontend:

[source,bash]
----
cd backend
./gradlew buildNative
----

IMPORTANT: This requires GraalVM to be installed and configured.

==== What This Command Does

. Builds the frontend (`npm run build` in `frontend/`)
. Copies frontend assets to `backend/build/resources/main/META-INF/resources/`
. Compiles the backend to a native executable using GraalVM's `native-image`
. Embeds all resources (including frontend) into the native binary

The native executable will be created in `backend/build/` with a name like `techwatch-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner` (or `.exe` on Windows).

==== Requirements

* *GraalVM 21+* with native-image tool installed
+
[source,bash]
----
# Verify GraalVM installation
java -version  # Should show GraalVM
native-image --version  # Should work
----

* *C++ compiler*
- Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 or later
- Linux: gcc and glibc-devel
- macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools

* *Sufficient RAM*: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended

* *Build time*: 5-15 minutes depending on your system

==== Frontend Integration in Native Build

The build process ensures the frontend is properly embedded:

[source,bash]
----
# The copyFrontend task runs automatically
# It copies from:  frontend/dist/
# To:              backend/build/resources/main/META-INF/resources/

# This means the native executable contains:
# - Backend API endpoints at /api/*
# - Frontend UI at / (root)
----

CAUTION: Native images are platform-specific. A native executable built on Windows only runs on Windows. Build on the target platform.

==== Running the Native Executable

[source,bash]
----
# On Windows
cd backend\build
techwatch-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.exe

# On Linux/Mac
cd backend/build
./techwatch-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
----

The application starts in under 1 second and uses significantly less memory than the JVM version.


---

== Windows Installation Guide

=== Application Installation

==== Option A: Run with Java Runtime

Verify Java 21 is installed:

[source,cmd]
----
java -version
----

Start the backend:

[source,cmd]
----
cd backend\build\quarkus-app
java -jar quarkus-run.jar
----

The backend API is now available at *http://localhost:8080*

==== Option B: Native Executable (Optional)

If you have GraalVM installed, you can build a native executable:

[source,bash]
----
cd backend
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native
----

The native executable will be generated in `backend/build/`

NOTE: Native compilation requires GraalVM and native-image tool installation.

=== Frontend Deployment

==== Option A: Serve with Static Server

[source,cmd]
----
cd frontend\dist
npx serve -s . -p 3000
----

Access the application at *http://localhost:3000*

==== Option B: Integrate with Backend

. Copy contents of `frontend/dist/` to `backend/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/`
. Rebuild the backend
. Access the application at *http://localhost:8080*

This option serves both API and UI from a single port.

---

== Troubleshooting

=== Backend won't start

* Verify Java 21 is installed: `java -version`
* Check if port 8080 is available
* Review logs in `backend/logs/`

=== Frontend can't connect to backend

* Ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:8080`
* Check CORS configuration in `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`
* Verify no firewall is blocking the connection

=== Extension can't send links

* Verify the API URL in extension settings
* Ensure backend is running and accessible
* Check browser console for errors (F12)

=== Database issues

* SQLite file location: `backend/data/mvt.db`
* ChromaDB directory: `backend/data/chromadb/`
* Backup these folders before major updates

=== Extension Issues

*Extension won't load*

* Verify all required files exist in `browser-extension/dist/`:
- `manifest.json`
- `background.js`
- `popup.html`
- `popup.js`
- `options.html`
- `options.js`
- `icons/` directory with icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png

* Check browser console (F12) on the extensions page for errors
* Look for red error messages in the extension card

*Build errors: "Module not found" or "unable to locate glob"*

This means source files are missing. You need to create them first:

[source,bash]
----
browser-extension/src/
├── background.js       ⚠️ MUST EXIST
├── popup.js            ⚠️ MUST EXIST
├── popup.html          ⚠️ MUST EXIST
├── options.js          ⚠️ MUST EXIST
├── options.html        ⚠️ MUST EXIST
├── manifest.json       ✓ Already exists
├── config.js           ✓ Already exists
└── icons/              ⚠️ MUST EXIST
    ├── icon16.png      ⚠️ REQUIRED
    ├── icon48.png      ⚠️ REQUIRED
    └── icon128.png     ⚠️ REQUIRED
----

Create all missing files as specified in the project setup documentation.

 icons, you can:

* Create simple colored squares using any image editor
* Download free icons from https://www.flaticon.com/[Flaticon] or https://www.iconfinder.com/[IconFinder]
* Use online icon generators like https://realfavicongenerator.net/[RealFaviconGenerator]

*"Missing script: watch" error*

Your `package.json` is outdated. Update it with:

[source,json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "watch": "webpack --mode development --watch",
    "dev": "webpack --mode development --watch"
  }
}
----

Then run:

[source,bash]
----
cd browser-extension
npm install
npm run watch
----

*Extension can't connect to backend*

. Verify the backend is running:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/q/health
# Should return: {"status":"UP"}
----

. Check extension settings:
- Click extension icon
- Click "Settings"
- Verify API URL is `http://localhost:8080`
- Click "Save Settings"

. Check browser console (F12 while on popup) for CORS or network errors

. Verify CORS is properly configured in `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
greeting:
  http:
    cors:
      origins: "http://localhost:3000,chrome-extension://*,moz-extension://*"
----

*Extension popup shows blank or won't open*

. Right-click the extension icon → Inspect popup
. Check the console for JavaScript errors
. Common issues:
- Missing `popup.js` script tag in `popup.html`
- Syntax errors in `popup.js`
- Chrome storage API not accessible (check permissions in manifest)

*Changes to extension not showing*

. After rebuild (watch mode), click the reload icon on the extension card in `chrome://extensions/`
. If that doesn't work:
- Remove the extension completely
- Close all browser windows
- Reopen browser
- Load the extension again from `browser-extension/dist/`

=== Frontend Issues

*Frontend shows blank page at localhost:3000*

. Verify backend is running on port 8080:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/q/health
----

. Check Vite console output for errors
. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
. Verify proxy configuration in `frontend/vite.config.js`:
+
[source,javascript]
----
server: {
    port: 3000,
    proxy: {
        '/api': {
            target: 'http://localhost:8080',
            changeOrigin: true,
        }
    }
}
----

*"Connection refused" or proxy errors*

. Backend must be running BEFORE starting frontend
. Start order:
.. `./gradlew :backend:quarkusDev` (wait for "Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080")
.. `npm run dev` in frontend directory

. If backend is running, check firewall settings

*"tsc not found" error during build*

TypeScript Compiler is missing. Install dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
cd frontend
npm install
----

This installs TypeScript as a dev dependency. The `tsc` command is part of the Node.js project, not a system-wide tool.

If the error persists:

[source,bash]
----
# Verify TypeScript is installed
npm list typescript

# If not found, install explicitly
npm install --save-dev typescript

# Then rebuild
npm run build
----

*Port 3000 already in use*

Another application is using port 3000. Options:

. Stop the other application
. Change Vite port in `frontend/vite.config.js`:
+
[source,javascript]
----
server: {
    port: 3001,  // Change this
    // ...
}
----

. Find and kill the process:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Linux/Mac
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
----

*Frontend works in dev but not in production JAR*

. Verify frontend was built before backend:
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean buildAll
----

. Check `backend/build/resources/main/META-INF/resources/` contains frontend files
. Access the app at `http://localhost:8080` (not 3000) when running from JAR
. In production, there is NO separate frontend server - everything is served from port 8080
